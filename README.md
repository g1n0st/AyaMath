## Usage

Including all the files as headfiles.

```c++
using namespace aya;
```

## Basic Target

A lite utility linear algebra math library including basic functionalities of Matrix, Vector , Quaternion and some simple math  algorithms. 

As a component of AyaRay developed by [Chang Yu](http://g1n0st.xyz/). 

## Design Mode

+ **Fully support `SIMD`  hardware acceleration (as a default mode).**, you can use `AYA_USE_SIMD`  macro in  `MathUtility.h` to switch on/off.

+  Adapt the architecture of `pbrt-v3`,  achieve all the functions existed in `pbrt-v3`'s `gemetry.h` in the same interfaces.


+ Avoid the tedious codes of building different base classes of Vector/Point/Normalï¼Œwhich means unnecessary overloading, copying and conversion. Abstract all this classes into `BaseVector3`,  all  subclasses inherit from it (including illegal methods that demand programmer to avoid it)


+ Considering the encode demand of `SIMD` and the confusing error `LNK2019` caused by c++  template use. Only support `float` type currently.
+ All functions are implemented as class member functions, following object-oriented thinking to ensure that namespaces are not contaminated. (Some functions need to use like `Matrix3x3().getIdentity()`)


+ Only support Windows(x86) platform currently.


+ Guarantee multi-thread safety.


+ Follow Google code style
